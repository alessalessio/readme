# Re-invent the pain

We have been interviewed in our life. It could have been for a new job, or a promotion. 
But, if we look back, we can think that our first interviews started all the way back at school.
In italian it is called 'interrogazione', which literally means 'interrogation', and it kind of gives you the idea of how the pupil is going to feel throughout the whole thing.
Then, if you proceed your studies and you get to go to the university, you most likely have to do a so called 'esame orale' in order to pass the exam.
And, again, the literal translation gives you the idea of the physical pain that the student has to 'endure' by definition (i.e.: 'oral examination')
