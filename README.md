# Working with AlessAlessio

This is intended to be a sort of manager's readme if you want to know more about me, whether or not you are going to work with me. 
While, this is not intended to be some kind of remainder, if you are already working with me, because I bet you had already figured this all out after the first month or so.

Well, my best guess is that you have already understood that I am italian. And, since italians are well known for their culinary passion, and for being food lovers, I'm not going to write this down as an agenda with bulletpoints and chapters. I'm going to explain how I work by telling you what my menu is. Hoping that you won't suffer any kind of indigestion at the end.


Antipasto

A good meal starts with a good conversation. A perfectly set table with quiet people around is not a good table. I'd rather have one with disposable forks on it but full of people who are happy to be there and share. 

It's always a good time to talk. 

I want you not be afraid to raise your hand and share something that you've just discovered: <em>a potential issue, a risk or if you simply need some help</em>.
Or if there's something that bothers you and you want to share it with me, don't be afraid of popping a message on Slack/Teams at anytime: you will hear me encouraging you, from time to time, to bring to my attention any situation that you felt uncomfortable with, or any source of stress that you have been facing.

I am not too precious about the 'how': an email or a message will do. I usually respond promptly during the office hours, but If I'm 'Away' or 'Out of Office' I will come back to you in the morning.

What to expect from me:
I try my best to communicate things trasparently and to the relevant audiences. If I have to share something within the team, or a subset of individuals, I tend to do it directly, mindful of everybody elseâ€™s time. 
I try my best to keep meetings at the minimum, making sure that all the people attending have an genuine interest in the matter discussed.
If I fail in any of the above things, it was certainly unintentional and I am more that happy to be told that I made a mistake. I will learn, and move on.

I don't send messages on Slack/Teams after office hours: you might have notifications on your phone and I don't want to disrupt you during your own time. 
If something pops up in my mind outside of working hours, and I want to make sure I don't forget it, I send an email. 

I am going to set up monthly 1 on 1 meetings, but I don't want people to wait for those meetings to talk to me. I always encourage partecipation and exchange of opinions, bearing in mind that no question is a stupid question, and every idea, no matter how crazy it sounds, is valuable and deserves attention. 

Does it sound like a good start? Appetite comes with eating, so they say...

Lasagna

We, as a team, work and sail towards the same objectives. We are on the same boat and I am, as much as you, part of the team. 
My aim is to bring each individual to a level of ownership where he has the skills, knowledge and tools to move forward, accomplish and success. 

What to expect from me:
I am here to guide, coach, clarify, simplify and reduce the noise around you. 
I want to plan together with you your career path. And if you don't have the answer to questions like 'where do you see yourself in 1 or 5 years?' . I'll help you come up with a plan.
We, as engineers, have a duty to ourselves to build up our skills, to evolve and to bring this know-how within the team and the product. I want to work with you and find the learning path that fits for you, like a tailor would sew your own suit. As a part of my job, I want to review how the learning path is going, and eventually adjust.  
I value ownership and risk taking. I want engineers to be able to trust their insticts, make decisions and be able to fail, learn and iterate. This is the safe path to success.

My aim is to drive each single one of you to be a distinguishable layer whose value brought to the final product is clearly visible, tangible and harmonized with the others. Wouldn't it make a perfect lasagna? 




Second course

I come from a technical background. And, as an engineer, I always found very useful to work with managers with a similar background. 

So, expect to see me partecipating in conversations around code, pipelines, resiliency patterns and dependency injection, as much as DDD, BDD, TDD and Glory of REST. I love my job and I'm passionate about it, and I will do my best to convey all of this to you on a daily basis.

What NOT to expect from me:
To bring a list of things to do, and then step away and watch from the outside. As I've already said, I am part of the team, and as long as I can bring value and help, I won't be afraid of diving deeper into techical matters, doing code reviews, or suggesting alternative approaches. 


Dessert

I love feedback. I encourage honest, impartial, eventually raw, feedback.   



There is one thing that I want to ask you in exchange. There will be times where not
