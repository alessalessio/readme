# Working with AlessAlessio

This is intended to be a sort of manager's readme if you want to know more about me, whether or not you are going to work with me. 
While, this is not intended to be some kind of remainder, if you are already working with me, because I bet you had already figured this all out after the first month or so.

Well, my best guess is that you have already understood that I am italian. And, since italians are well known for their culinary passion, and for being food lovers, I'm not going to write this down as an agenda with bulletpoints and chapters. I'm going to explain how I work by telling you what my menu is. Hoping that you won't suffer any kind of indigestion at the end.


Antipasto

A good meal starts with a good conversation. A perfectly set table with quiet people around is not a good table. I'd rather have one with disposable forks on it but full of people who are happy to be there and share. 
For me, It's always a good time to talk. Don't be afraid of sharing something. I'm not too picky about the format or the way things are shared. And anytime of the day will do. And if you leave a message outside working hours, I will be picking it up in the morning. I will not be sending messages after hours myself, because you might have notifications on your phone. If something pops up in my mind outside of working hours,  and I want to make sure I don't forget it, I 

I will be setting up monthly 1 on 1 meetings, but I don't want people to wait for those meetings to talk to me. I always encourage partecipation and exchange of opinions, bearing in mind that no question is a stupid question, and every idea, no matter how crazy it sounds, is valuable and deserves attention. 


Lasagna

We, as a team, work and sail towards the same objectives. We are on the same boat and I am, as much as you, part of the team. My aim is to bring each individual to a level of ownership where he has the skills, knowledge and tools to move forward, accomplish and success. I will be there to guide, coach, clarify, simplify and reduce the noise around you. My aim is to drive each single one of you to be a distinguishable layer whose value brought to the final product is clearly visible, tangible and harmonized with the other layers. Wouldn't it make a perfect lasagna? 


Second course

I come from a technical background. And, as an engineer, I always found very useful to work with managers with a similar background. So, expect me to see me partecipating in conversations around code, pipelines, resiliency patterns and dependency injection, as much as DDD, BDD, TDD and Glory of REST. I love my job and I'm passionate about it, and I will do my best to convey all of this to you on a daily basis.


Dessert

I love feedback. I encourage honest, impartial, eventually raw, feedback.   



There is one thing that I want to ask you in exchange. There will be times where not
