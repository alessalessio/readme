# Working with AlessAlessio

This is intended to give you an idea of how I work, what and what not to expect from me.

Well, my best guess is that you have figured out I am italian. Yes, I am. And I love watching football, listening and playing music of all sort, and cooking. 
Here is my menu for you today. Hoping that you won't suffer any kind of indigestion at the end.


## Antipasto

A good meal starts with a good conversation. A perfectly set table with quiet people around is not a good table. 

With this I just want to say that <em>It's always a good time to talk</em>. 

Do not be afraid to raise your hand and share what you have in mind.
Is there something that bothers you and you want to share it with me? 
Do you want to bring to my attention any situation that you felt uncomfortable with, or any source of stress that you have been facing?
If you're remote, just pop a message on Slack/Teams at anytime; if you're in the office, drop by my desk.

In general, I am not too precious about the 'how' when it comes to communication: an email or a message will do. I usually respond promptly during the office hours, but If I'm 'Away' or 'Out of Office' I will come back to you in the morning.

### What to expect from me:
I try my best to communicate things trasparently and to the relevant audiences. If I have to share something within the team, or a subset of individuals, I tend to do it directly, mindful of everybody else’s time. 
I try my best to keep meetings at the minimum, making sure that all the people attending have an genuine interest in the matter discussed.

I don't send messages on Slack/Teams after office hours: you might have notifications on your phone and I don't want to disrupt you during your own time. 
If something pops up in my mind outside of working hours, and I want to make sure I don't forget it, I just send an email. 

I am going to set up monthly 1 on 1 meetings, but I don't want people to wait for those meetings to talk to me. I always encourage partecipation and exchange of opinions, bearing in mind that no question is a stupid question, and every idea, no matter how crazy it sounds, is valuable and deserves attention. 

Does it sound like a good start? Appetite comes with eating, so they say...

## Lasagna

We, as a team, work and sail towards the same objectives. We are on the same boat and I am, as much as you, part of the team. 
My aim is to bring each individual to a level of ownership where he has the skills, knowledge and tools to move forward, accomplish and success. 

### What to expect from me:
I am here to guide, coach, clarify, simplify and reduce the noise around you. 
I want to plan together with you your career path. And if you don't have the answer to questions like 'where do you see yourself in 1 or 5 years?'. 
I'll help you find them.

We, as engineers, have a duty to ourselves to build up our skills, to evolve and to bring this know-how within the team and the product. I want to work with you and find the learning path that fits for you. It is part of my job to review how your learning path is going, and give you the oppportunities to grow professionally.

### What NOT to expect from me:
Blaming and finger pointing when you make a mistake.

I value ownership and risk taking. I want engineers to be able to trust their insticts, make decisions and be able to fail, learn and iterate. 
This is the safe path to success.

My aim is to drive each single one of you to be a distinguishable layer whose value brought to the final product is clearly visible, tangible and harmonized with the others. Wouldn't it make a perfect lasagna? 


## Second course

![alt text](spiedini.jpg)

I come from a technical background. And, as an engineer, I always found very useful to work with managers with a similar background. 

### What to expect from me:
So, you will see me partecipating in conversations around code, pipelines, resiliency patterns and dependency injection, as much as DDD, BDD, TDD and Glory of REST. I love my job and I'm passionate about it, and I will do my best to convey all of this to you on a daily basis.

### What NOT to expect from me:
To bring a list of things to do, and then step away and watch from the outside. As I've said, I am part of the team, and as long as I can bring value and help, I won't be afraid of diving deeper into techical matters, or suggesting alternative approaches. 


## Dessert

I love feedback. I encourage honest, impartial, eventually raw, feedback. 
I respect and value diversity and I am a strong supporter of cultural diversity. 


## Values I encourage

- <em>disagree and commit</em> <br />
I ask you to bring your own ideas, and argue your case. Ultimately, the team discuss and the team decides what it's the best. <br />
Once the decision is taken, everyone commits to its success. 

* <em>think outside the box</em> <br />
If you spot a problem that it's not your responsibility, you will try to fix it anyway or raise it to someone who can. <br />
Think of the impact that your decisions may affect other teams or modules/components. It's everyone's responsibility to look after the product as a whole

* <em>respect and support</em> <br />
Be always respectful of anyone else's work. <br />
Support your teammates since day one. Understand new hires challenges, no matter how senior you are 


## Things I suggest
* <em>automation</em> <br />
If there's something that you're repeating manually over the course of time, just stop and ask you? Can I automate this? <br />
Time 'lost' in setting up repeatable processes is going to pay back over the course of time, always <br />
When is the right time to setup a Build&Release pipeline? And automated tests? Right after you create the code repo. You should be able to deploy and test code from the very first line you commit.

* <em>don’t reinvent the wheel</em> <br />
Be efficient, don't try to overcomplicate things. Coding everything from scratch is not always the best way. <br />
Before starting, do your research, without dismissing the idea of leveraging third-party libraies or services to speed-up things and simplify. <br />

* [<em>KISS</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)<br />


* <em>document your choices</em> <br />
An extra line of comment in the code has never killed anybody, but it saved hundred hours of dev's time. <br />
Use meaningful names: someone who doesn't have a clue of what your class does, shoud be able to understand it by just reading the names of your methods and variables you've used <br />
When you estimate your work, be sure to include the time you need to document what you've done. It's always better to explain what you did and how you did it, right after you finished, when it's still fresh in your mind. <br />
Be mindful of who is going to read the documentation. And if you need to write different documents for the various stakeholders, take your time and do it <br />
